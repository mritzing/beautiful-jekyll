The goal of this project was the create interactive visualizations of the films avaialable for streaming from Virginia Tech [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).   In order to build the visualizations the data collected and process through the usage of python [scripts](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal) and then
the visualizations were created in Tableau and Gephi.  All files used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal).

## Visualizations 
The visualizations for this project were created in Tableau (the interactive dashboard) and Gephi (the network graph) both these programs are free to download and additional training can be found in the library's [Data Visualization Studio](https://datavizstudio.lib.vt.edu/)

## Utilizing Basic Programming to Improve Workflow
Through this project I would like to show off how programming is not as scary as people make it out to be.  Instead of creating one large software suite I have seperated each file to make them more simple to understand.

## Swank Database
Virginia Tech offers **900+** movies available to stream [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).  The first step of this project was to get a list of all the films available and since there was no easy access to the backend of the database basic HTML parsing was utilized to extract the titles and poster images. The files for that can be found [here](!TODO GET LINK)

## Data Collection
There are a few data sources that can be used here to collect additional information about the films, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and Google search results just to name a few.  For this project this project a combination of the data from the TMDB api and results from Google searches were combined to form the [final dataset](here).  Some manual data cleaning was done, primarily involving fixing instances of films with the same title.



## Boxes
