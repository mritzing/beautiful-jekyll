# mritzing.github.io
The goal of this project was the create interactive visualizations of the films avaialable for streaming from Virginia Tech [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).   In order to build the visualizations the data was collected and process through the usage of python [scripts](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal) and then
the visualizations were created in Tableau and Gephi.  All files used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal).

## Visualizations 
The visualizations for this project were created in Tableau (the interactive dashboard) and Gephi (the network graph) both these programs are free to download and additional training can be found in the library's [Data Visualization Studio](https://datavizstudio.lib.vt.edu/).

## Utilizing Basic Programming to Improve Workflow
Through this project I would like to show off how programming is not as scary as people make it out to be.  Instead of creating one large software suite I have seperated each file to make them more simple to understand.

# Data Collection and Manipulation
## Swank Database
Virginia Tech offers **900+** movies available to stream [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).  The first step of this project was to get a list of all the films available and since there was no easy access to the backend of the database basic HTML parsing was utilized to extract the titles and poster images. The files for that can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal/tree/master/DataCollection)

## Data Collection
There are a few data sources that can be used here to collect additional information about the films, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), and Google search results just to name a few.  For this project this project a combination of the data from the TMDB api and results from Google searches were combined to form the [final dataset](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal/blob/master/DataCollection/movieDataMore.xlsx).  Some manual data cleaning was done, primarily involving fixing instances of films with the same title.

# Visualizations 
The two visualization tools used were Tableau and Gephi, both of these tools are free to use and training for them is available at the [Data Visualization Studio](https://datavizstudio.lib.vt.edu/).
## Tableau
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is a data visualization tool that allows users to make interactive dashboards to show off their data.

In this project the user is able to narrow down the selection of movies using a several filters (genre, rating, MPAA rating, duration, release date).  All the films are displayed in a graph that uses their poster images as their repesentative custom shapes.  By clicking on the film additional information and a web image is displayed. This Tableau workbook is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-z8PAleZctttDz0EbzSgqEGismSpERbQ/view?usp=sharing)
## Gephi
[Gephi](gephi.org) allows one to make network graphs, which is an effective way to show connections between data points.

For this network graph the top five billed actors off the Google search results were used as the nodes, the dots on the graph, and the lines, edges, between them were the films they were in together.  The nodes are colored and sized based on number of occurences, Tom Hanks appears more than any other actor in the films we have so he is the largest.  The edges are also sized based on number of connections so the darkest line appears around the three stars of the Harry Potter films, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, as they were in seven movies together.  The Gephi files and scripts used to parse the data files into Gephi compatable files can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal/tree/master/Gephi)

## Conclusion
somethign about how a more complex program couldve been written but i wanted to show off what can be done with basic scripting in combination with visualization techniques
