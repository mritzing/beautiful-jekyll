The goal of this project was the create visualizations of the films avaialable for streaming from Virginia Tech [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).   In order to build the visualizations the data collected and process through the usage of python [scripts](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal) and then
the visualizations were created in Tableau and Gephi.  All files used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal).
**Here is some bold text**

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
