The goal of this project was the create interactive visualizations of the films avaialable for streaming from Virginia Tech [here](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.ezproxy.lib.vt.edu/vtc299211/admin/Login?returnUrl=/vtc299211/Admin).   In order to build the visualizations the data collected and process through the usage of python [scripts](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal) and then
the visualizations were created in Tableau and Gephi.  All files used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mritzing/movieVizFinal).

## Utilizing Basic Programming to Improve Workflow
Words, small scripts (less scary), can be used to greatly improve workflow for repetative tasks, demys

## Visualizations 
The visualizations for this project were created in Tableau (the interactive dashboard) and Gephi (the network graph) both these programs are free to download and additional training can be found in the library's [Data Visualization Studio](https://datavizstudio.lib.vt.edu/)

## Swank Database

Virginia Tech offers **900+** movies available to stream 
Here's a code chunk


~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
